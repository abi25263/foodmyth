  <div class="row">
    <div class="cell wow fadeInRight" data-wow-delay="2s"><img src="img/doge_1.gif" alt=""/>
  <p class="big1">  Most laying hens in the U.S. are Single-Comb White Leghorns.
  Egg farms were still mostly backyard systems that supplied families with eggs. Any extras were sold at the local farmers’
  markets. As selling eggs became profitable, some farms started building up flocks of about 400 hens. The hens roamed around
  outside with a coop for roosting.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="cell">
      <div class="cell wow fadeInLeft" data-wow-delay="1s">
      <h2 class="type2"> Anicent times egg production</h2>
        <p class="big1"> East Indian history indicates that wild fowl were domesticated as early as 3200 B.C.
          Egyptian and Chinese records show that fowl were laying eggs for man in 1400 B.C. and Europe has had domesticated
          hens since 600 B.C. While there’s evidence of native fowl in the Americas prior to Columbus’ arrival, it’s believed
          that on his second trip, he carried the first chickens related to those now in egg production.Nearly 200 breeds and
          varieties of chickens have been established worldwide.

      <h2 class="type2">Early 1900 t0 1960 egg production </h2>
      <p class="big1"> The caging system also lent itself to increased automation, which was needed to handle the
        increased output of eggs from the hens. Conveyor belts were added to the hen house to collect the eggs as soon as
        they were laid and carry them to the washers.
        <br />
        By the early 1960s, improved technology and the development of sophisticated mechanical equipment were responsible for a shift to larger commercial operations.

      Improving the health of hens through more protective housing and better feeding facilities led to more eggs which led to increased automation to handle the eggs.
      With increased automation, labor costs were reduced, providing a lower cost to the consumer. In addition to much improved hen health,
      equal-opportunity feeding also made the nutrient quality of eggs more uniform.

        <h2 class="type2"> Modern day egg production</h2>
        <p class="big1"> Each of the roughly 300 million laying birds in the U.S. produces from 250 to 300 eggs
          a year. In total, the U.S. produces about 75 billion eggs a year, about 10% of the world supply.
          About 60% of the eggs produced are used by consumers, about 9% are used by the foodservice industry.
          The rest are turned into egg products which are used mostly by foodservice operators (restaurants) and
          by food manufacturers to make foods like mayonnaise and cake mixes.

              The eggs of birds and reptiles (think turtle eggs) have been gathered for food since the dawn of man—and enjoyed by other animals since,
              well, the dawn of eggs. The most commonly-raised are chicken eggs; duck, goose, ostrich and quail eggs are used as gourmet ingredients;
              pheasant eggs and emu eggs can sometimes be found. But the ubiquitous chicken egg holds center stage in our egg glossary.
              Eggs are an inexpensive source of protein, a versatile ingredient and an essential component of foods we hold dear, from omelets to cakes and cookies.
              Just a few years ago, you had a choice of white or brown eggs. (White eggs come from white hen varieties, brown eggs come from brown-feathered hens,
              and are a bit more expensive because brown hens tend to be larger and consume more feed.) Today, there are 10 choices to be made in chicken eggs alone.
              In addition to the regular brown and white eggs of yore, here are eight additional choices—most of which are available in brown or white as well.
              We also briefly address the other types of eggs that can be found in specialty food stores, on restaurant menus, and the websites of breeders who make
              them available to consumers nationwide.

            <h2 class="type2"> Aracauna Eggs</h2>
            <p class="big1">
              Aracauna eggs are from Aracauna chickens, native to South America. Nutritionally, these bluish-green eggs are not much different fro traditional white and brown eggs.
              Although some people think aracauna eggs are lower in cholesterol, eggs from this breed have a higher cholesterol content. While eggs in the U.S. come from cost-effective
              breeds that yield white or brown eggs, some non-commercial breeders have heritage breeds that yield beautiful colors, like the aracauna. For example, Penedesencas from Spain
              lay eggs that are a very dark, reddish brown.” Cuckoo Marans and Welsummers lay speckled eggs. Some Eggers lay pale green and olive. All in all, there’s a rainbow of options.
            </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="cell">
            <h2 class="type2"> Brown & White Eggs</h2>
            <p class="big1">
              When it comes to hue of the egg, the key lies in the breed of chicken. In general, white-feathered chickens with white earlobes lay white eggs, and reddish-brown-feathered
              chickens with red earlobes lay brown eggs. There are also breeds that lay less commonly found blue eggs and speckled eggs.
              Because brown eggs tend to cost more, people assume they are more nutritious and more delicious. But that is not the case. Brown eggs are more expensive because of their size.
              Red-feathered chickens tend to weigh more than white-feathered chickens—and the bigger the bird, the bigger the egg! Larger chickens require more food and land to remain healthy
              throughout production. Higher production costs lead to more expensive products in the end.
            Some people also think that one color shell is harder than the other, or that there are different colored yolks. These factors are due to the age and feed of the chickem. The coloring of shells or bird rather has nothing to do with this.

            <h2 class="type2"> Shell of the egg</h2>
            <p class="big1">
              The shell of the egg is composed of calcium carbonate. It prevents bacteria and other microbes from entering, which is why you should not use cracked eggs.
              Shell color in chickens and other animals will vary by species. In chickens, it can range from bright white to brown; shell color is purely aesthetic and has no impact on the
              flavor, nutrition, or quality of the egg. The reason most of our eggs are white is because the breeds that are the highest producers (i.e., lay the most eggs) lay white eggs.
              As you can see in the photo at the top of the page, rare heritage breeds of chicken can lay eggs in the most exquisite colors—coral, robin’s egg blue, olive green and lavender.
              You’d swear they were dyed, but they aren’t.If they taste better, it’s because free range chickens that are allowed to scratch and peck for grubs and other insects, supplemented
              with the finest organic feed, taste a lot better than factory-produced chickens that get no muscle-building exercise and eat cheap feed.

    <h1 class="type1"> Cholesterol Myth</h1>
  <div class="row-column">
      <p class="big1">
        Many Americans have shied away from eggs – despite their taste, value, convenience and nutrition – for fear of dietary cholesterol.
        However, more than 40 years of research have demonstrated that healthy adults can enjoy eggs without significantly impacting their risk of heart
        disease. In fact, research has shown that saturated fat may be more likely to raise a person’s serum cholesterol than dietary cholesterol.
        According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) nutrition data, eggs are lower in cholesterol than previously recorded.
        The USDA recently reviewed the nutrient composition of standard large eggs and results show the average amount of cholesterol in one
        large egg is 185 mg, down from 215 mg, a 14 percent decrease. The analysis also revealed that large eggs now contain 41 IU of Vitamin D,
        an increase of 64 percent.Enjoying an egg a day can fall within current cholesterol guidelines, particularly if people opt for other low-cholesterol
        foods throughout the day. If you are concerned about dietary cholesterol you could choose to eat one whole egg plus two egg whites for a fulfilling meal to start the
        day. Nearly half of the protein and most of the vitamins and minerals are contained in the yolk so don’t skip the yolk altogether!
      Several international health promotion organizations – including Health Canada, the Canadian Heart and Stroke Foundation, the Australian
      Heart Foundation and the Irish Heart Foundation – promote eggs as part of a heart-healthy diet, recognizing that they make important nutritional contributions.
